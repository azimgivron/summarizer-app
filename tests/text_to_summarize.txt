1.  
ONCE UPON A TIME, there was a goat who had seven kids. She loved them as a mother loves her children. One day, when she wanted to go into the forest to fetch food, she called all seven of them together:  
"My dear little ones, I am going to the forest; take great care and beware of the wolf. If he comes here, he will devour you. He is a wicked scoundrel who often disguises himself, but you can recognize him by his rough voice and black paws."  
The kids replied:  
"Yes, dear mother, we will be very careful, and you can leave without worry."  
Reassured, the mother set off on her way.

2.  
Not much time passed before someone came to their door, knocked, and called:  
"Open up, my dear children; it’s your mother back from the forest, bringing something for each of you!"  
But the kids recognized the wolf’s rough voice and said:  
"No, we won’t open! You are not our mother, who has a sweet and gentle voice. You have a coarse voice—you are the wolf!"  
The wolf then ran to the shopkeeper and bought a large piece of chalk, which he swallowed to soften his voice.

3.  
He returned, knocked at the door, and said:  
"Open up, my dear children; it’s your mother back from the forest, bringing something for each of you!"  
But the wolf had pressed his black paw against the windowsill, and the little kids, seeing it, cried:  
"No, we won’t open! Our mother doesn’t have an ugly black paw like you. You are the wolf!"

4.  
So the wolf ran to the baker.  
"I’ve hurt my paw; spread some dough over it for me."

5.  
When the baker had smeared his paw with dough, the wolf trotted to the miller:  
"Sprinkle this dough with white flour."  
But the miller thought, "The wolf must be trying to trick someone." So he refused.  
Then the wolf used his coarse voice:  
"If you don’t do it, I’ll devour you!"  
Terrified, the miller whitened his paw. Indeed, people are like that.

6.  
Now the wicked wolf returned for the third time and knocked on the door:  
"Open up, my dear children; it’s your loving mother back from the forest with something special for each of you!"  
"Show us your paw first, so we can see if you are really our loving mother."  
The wolf placed his paw on the window, and when they saw that it was white, they believed him.  
They opened the door.

7.  
But who came in? The wolf.  
The kids were terrified and tried to hide.  
One jumped under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the fireplace, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the sixth behind the washing tub, and the seventh into the clock case.

8.  
The wolf found and swallowed them all, one after another.  
All... except the youngest, who was the smallest and had hidden in the clock. The wolf did not find him.  
Satisfied, the wolf left and lay down under a tree in a nearby meadow, where he soon fell asleep.

9.  
When the poor mother goat returned from the forest, she discovered the horrifying scene!  
The front door was wide open, the table, chairs, and benches overturned, the washing tub upside down, and the bed completely unmade, with the blankets torn off. She looked for her little ones but could find them nowhere.  
One by one, she called their names, but there was no response.  
Finally, when she called the youngest, a tiny voice replied:  
"Dear mother, I am hiding in the clock case."  
He told her that the wolf had come and devoured all the others.  
Heartbroken, she left the house, followed by the youngest kid.

10.  
When she arrived at the meadow, the wolf was lying under the tree, snoring loudly. The goat examined him closely from all sides and saw that something seemed to be moving and wriggling inside his swollen belly.  
"Could it be that my poor little ones, whom he swallowed for his supper, are still alive?"

11.  
Quickly, the youngest kid ran home to fetch scissors, a needle, and strong thread.  
The mother goat began cutting open the monster’s belly.  
At the first snip of the scissors, a little kid poked out his head! She kept cutting, and all six kids, one after the other, jumped out. They were all alive and without a single scratch; the monster had swallowed them whole without even biting them.  
What joy there was!  
The goat told them to gather large stones to fill the belly of the wicked beast while he was still sleeping.  
They stuffed his stomach with as many stones as they could find. Then the mother goat sewed it up so quickly and skillfully that the wolf didn’t feel a thing and didn’t even wake up.

12.  
Finally, when the wolf had slept his fill, he stretched and got back on his feet.  
Feeling very thirsty, he decided to go to the well to drink.  
As he walked, the stones in his belly rolled and knocked against each other.  
He exclaimed:  
"Why do I feel so heavy and bloated? I thought I had eaten six kids, but it feels like I’m carrying stones!"

13.  
When he reached the well and leaned over to drink, the weight of the stones pulled him down, and he fell into the well, sinking to the bottom, where he drowned miserably.  
The seven kids, who had been watching from a distance, came running and danced around the well with their mother, singing joyfully:  
"The wolf is dead! The wolf is dead!"  
And so our story ends.
